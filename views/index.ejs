      Welcome. This whiteboard is real-time. I used Node.js as the server, Socket.io for real-time collaboration, Express as the web framework and HTML5 Canvas for the whiteboard space. This can be a great space for drawing anything together, anytime.

      This app was built to learn how to use new technologies. I am interested in creating collaborative spaces for foreign language instruction. There's so much potential in real-time collaboration to bring teachers and learners together to learn a new language! I hope to include video and voice sharing in the future, along with other collaborative tools. If you have any ideas about how to make this space great for language learners, check out the repo: <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/daschi/whiteboard-app">Simple Whiteboard on Github</a>
